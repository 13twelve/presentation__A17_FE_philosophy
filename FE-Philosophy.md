# Title

A17 FE philosophy and boilerplate

# Description

Since starting to work with AREA 17 in 2008, Mike has been lucky to be able to help grow and shape the discipline and how its practiced at the company; today engineering is at A17’s very core. Some areas he'll cover:

* the relationship between design and engineering at A17,
* A17 FE philosophy,
* how A17 apply it internally and externally,
* an introduction to the A17 FE code boilerplate

## relationship between design and engineering at A17

* historically, design dominated, engineering less so
* recently, working towards balance
* 2016 focus on engineering, greater integration
  * guides
  * boilerplate
  * js helpers

> Engineering is as core to AREA 17 as any other aspect of the work AREA 17 produces.

## A17 FE philosophy

* Make projects better
* Cutting edge, not bleeding edge
* Elegant simple solutions
* You can't know everything
* Never letting a project fail
* Don't be afraid to say no

* Communication
  * with BE
  * with Designers
  * with Producers
  * with each other
    * rubber duck debugging
    * showing off

* Supported Browsers
* Unsupported Browsers

## A17 FE philosophy - communication

Every project is a collaborative effort between a number of people, all of which are pushing to make the best product within any given constraints.

It is vitally important that we reach out to designers, project managers and fellow developers when we spot an area a project can be improved, when we’re heading down an engineering black hole or when we just aren’t sure about something.

## A17 FE rules examples

* git strategy
* 3rd party libraries
* Client side rendering
* social links
* video players

## A17 FE boilerplate

* dotfiles
* base JS
* base SCSS
* build tools
* standardising approach

The boilerplate is intended to be extended as a project needs, but give you a solid base to get started with. It enforces some coding styles, file structures and nomenclature.
More like a more involved HTML5 boilerplate than Bootstrap
